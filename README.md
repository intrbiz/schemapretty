SchemaPretty
==========
A quick a dirty pretty PostgreSQL schema dumper

SchemaPretty will dump (the important bits) of a PostgreSQL schema 
into a pretty directory structure, which is nice for using with 
SCM.

The idea is to dump each entity as a separate file, which is then 
really easy to manage changes using SCMs such as git.
